# TelegramBot

Here we have a bot for telegram to reserve schedule and time-lapse. It works with Mongo DB.

Two main tasks to do:
- Needs a system to give clearly information about the reservations made. Maybe with JavaFx we can send an image that represents a week.
- Works with only one thread. It can't work fine if we serve more than one user at once.
